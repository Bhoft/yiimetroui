yii metroui extension

This extension will be build upon yii2, it's hardly in development status. If you wanna take a look and
enhace it, you are pretty welcome!

As I'm not an educated programmer, some of the code could be rubbish, but I try to learn from other
developers which are in my opinion well skilled! :)

If you have questions, feel free to contact me!
